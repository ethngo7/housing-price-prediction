# Housing Price Prediction in Cook County

This project applies regression modeling to predict housing prices in Cook County, Illinois. The goal is to build an accurate and fair model while considering social and ethical implications of predictive errors in property valuation, particularly in the context of racial inequality and tax fairness. Here is an article detailing the situation in 2017: [Chicago Tribune](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Parcel-Sales/wvhk-k5uv](https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html)

## 📌 Project Summary

- Used feature engineering to create interpretable and relevant predictors
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and handled outliers
- Trained linear regression models and evaluated with RMSE
- Considered the social consequences of prediction errors (e.g. over/undervaluation for different income groups)

## 📊 Dataset Source

This project uses the [Assessor – Parcel Sales dataset](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Property-Taxation/Assessor-Parcel-Sales/wvhk-k5uv/about_data) provided by the Cook County Assessor’s Office.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data wrangling and cleaning  
- Feature extraction (log transforms, domain-specific features)  
- Model training and validation  
- Use of `sklearn` and `pandas` for predictive modeling  
- Awareness of fairness in machine learning
